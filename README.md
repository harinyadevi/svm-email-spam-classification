# Spam classification using SVM (Support Vector Machines)

#### Unsolicited junk mails are called SPAM mails which are sent to indiscriminate recipients, usually for commercial purposes. Sometimes, spam emails can have malicious content that can affect the userâ€™s computers. Hence, spam classification is an integral part of emails. 
#### A substantial number of classification techniques have been identified for spam filtering, out of which, SVM (Support Vector Machine) which uses Machine Learning is used extensively for its generalized performance. 
#### It delivers high accuracy and has an advantage of robustness and effectiveness when the number of dimensions are greater than the number of samples.
